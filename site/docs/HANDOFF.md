## T0 Scaffold + handoff docs (done, 2026-10-05)

**Built**
- `index.html`: placeholder nav (fixed), `#track` (tall scroll track) > `#stage` (sticky, 100svh), `#debug` overlay. GSAP 3.15.0 + ScrollTrigger + MotionPathPlugin + DrawSVGPlugin from cdnjs (all registered in main.js). Fonts: Inter + Inter Tight (Google Fonts).
- `js/config.js`: **single source of truth**. `SCENES` = 14 entries (id, kind, frames, title, `units`, optional `mobileUnits`, `module`). 1 unit = 100svh of scroll. Total is currently 20.4 units. `SCRUB = 0.5`, `BREAKPOINT = 900`.
- `js/main.js`: inside `gsap.matchMedia` (isDesktop / isMobile / reduced) it
  - creates one `<section class="layer layer--<id>">` per scene in `#stage`
  - builds one paused master timeline with a label per scene id (plus `end`)
  - calls each module's `build(master, ctx)`, where `ctx = { scene, layer, stage, isMobile, reduced, duration, start }`
  - sets `--track-units` so that scroll length = timeline length
  - binds the timeline with `ScrollTrigger.create({ trigger: #track, start: 'top top', end: 'bottom bottom', scrub: 0.5, animation })`
  - `window.__film = { master, trigger, scenes }` is exposed for console debugging
- `js/scenes/placeholder.js`: used for every scene whose `module` is `null`. It shows a labelled card that fades in and drifts across the segment. The first scene is visible at scroll 0.
- `js/debug.js`: `?debug` overlay showing the current label, overall and segment %, and a clickable label list that jumps to each segment via `trigger.labelToScroll(id)`. The list is hidden under 900px.
- CSS: `tokens.css` holds provisional palette and type tokens (T1 replaces them with exact values), `base.css` the reset, track/stage, nav and debug styles, `scenes.css` the placeholder styles plus a minimal `.is-reduced` stacked fallback.
- `.claude/launch.json` (in the parent folder), "site" attaches to http://localhost:8080.

**How to add a real scene** (T3 onwards): create `js/scenes/sNN-name.js` exporting `build(tl, ctx)`, set `module: 'sNN-name.js'` on its config entry, and add tweens at `ctx.scene.id` (relative offsets like `` `${id}+=0.4` ``), keeping them within `ctx.duration`. Style it under `.layer--<id>` in scenes.css. Tweens that cross into a neighbouring scene (true transitions) belong to the **transition** entry (t1…t5), which may reach the shared elements listed in ASSET_MAP.

**Running locally (important)**
- The app's preview launcher **cannot read iCloud Drive** (macOS privacy: `getcwd: Operation not permitted`). Start the server from the Bash tool instead, as a background task:
  `cd ".../Claude files/site" && exec python3 -m http.server 8080`
  Then use `preview_start` with name `site`, or navigate the Browser pane to `http://localhost:8080/?debug`.
- If the Browser pane is **hidden**, rAF is paused and scrub never advances, so scroll tests return t=0. Either front the pane (`tabs_select`) and take a screenshot, or verify deterministically: `__film.trigger.disable(false,false); __film.master.time(x)`, then check layer opacities, then `trigger.enable(false,true)`.

**Verified**
- Desktop (1024×768): for all 14 segments, forward then reverse, exactly the matching layer is visible at mid-segment, and the debug label matches.
- Scroll mapping: 768px of scroll = 1 unit = 1 viewport, and progress 0/.25/.5/.75/1 maps exactly.
- Mobile (375×812): renders, no horizontal overflow, no console errors (all requests 200).
- Screenshots: `docs/shots/t0-desktop-s3-scan.jpg`, `docs/shots/t0-mobile-s7-clean.jpg`.

**Known issues / notes**
- Reduced motion only gets a crude stacked fallback (`.is-reduced`). The real version is T14. I could not emulate reduced motion in the pane (no tool option).
- Nav is a placeholder (text "P" logo). The real logo comes in T1 and nav styling in T2.
- Scene `units` are first guesses. Tune them only in config.js.

**Next step → T1:** write `tools/extract.py` (python3 is available; check whether Pillow/cwebp exist first, otherwise use `sips` for JPEG) to decode each SVG's `image0_*` base64 PNG, dedupe by hash, and apply the `<pattern>` transform/rect placement so each crop matches its frame. Export to `assets/img/` as listed in ASSET_MAP. Then isolate the vector parts into `assets/svg/` (logo; 5 vital icons with each glyph split from its blur-filter shadow; ROI boxes; D16 beams; D17/D18 arrows, RGB box, curves, rectangle; D19 card charts), set exact palette hex values in `tokens.css`, and fill in ASSET_MAP.
